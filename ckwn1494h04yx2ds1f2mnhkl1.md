## How to read print manhua in 2021

This is a follow-up to [last year’s post about the excellent Bilibili Manhua app](https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/60732-first-impressions-of-the-bilibili-manhua-app/). In the 11 months since then, I’ve read a lot of print manhua[1], so I figured it was about time to share my findings.

Currently, I find these to be the most convenient tools for consuming print manhua:

-  [Bilibili Manhua iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1426252715) 
-  [Mox.moe website](https://mox.moe/) 
-  [Manhuaren mobile app](http://manhuaren.com/) (iOS and Android) 

The Bilibili Manhua iOS app is easy to use (assuming your language level is good enough to navigate its Chinese interface) and content is very cheap[2]. Image quality is great and in the case of Japanese manga you're getting the official Chinese translations. The main drawback is that the selection is a bit limited. For example, Japanese manga is mostly limited to series from Shonen Jump and its sister publications. You'll probably need an iPad—I think the text is generally too small to be legible on an iPhone screen. All of the content you’ll find here is printed in simplified characters.

Mox.moe is a manhua website that lets you download scans of print manhua for free. You must be a registered user to download files, and registration is free. You won't be able to download some files until you’ve been a fully-registered user for at least three months. The selection is much better than Bilibili, but image and translation quality vary greatly. Any listing not marked as 高清 (high resolution) probably isn’t worth downloading. Most of the content is in traditional characters, but there is plenty of material in simplified as well. To prevent abuse, the site limits how much and how fast you can download files. Unless you’re a very prolific reader, you aren’t likely to exceed the download limits. A pretty annoying limitation of Mox.moe is that you can’t read anything directly on the site. That means you could spend 20-30 minutes downloading a volume containing hundreds of pages only to read 10 pages and conclude you don’t like it at all! That’s where the third and last tool comes in…

The Manhuaren mobile app lets you view bootleg manhua for free. It gets all of its content from manhua website [DM5](https://dm5.com/), but the app offers a nicer experience because it doesn’t have ads. Since almost all the content in Manhuaren is bootleg, the image quality is often poor. I mostly only mention this tool because it’s a good way to quickly preview a series you see on Mox.moe before you consume download credits to obtain the file. Content on Manhuaren can be in either traditional or simplified, and if it’s a translated series, chapters can switch between the two character sets depending on where the translation came from.

I think that’s about all you need to know to read most of the print manhua out there! I assume that these tools I recommended will work anywhere, but note that I’m writing from the perspective of someone living in the US.

[1]: Print manhua refers to 漫画 (comics) that are originally published in magazines or books. This is in contrast to条漫 (webtoons), which are meant to be read on mobile devices.

[2]: Prices range from free to USD 12 cents per chapter. If you have a monthly subscription, it’s about 5 cents per chapter (before tax).
